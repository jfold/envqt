# ENVQT
Exploiting Noise in Variational Quantum Thermalization (ENVQT) is an algorithm used to learn the parameters in a variational quantum circuit which prepares a thermal state of a Hamiltonian. Different from other approaches it considers the noise itself as a variational parameter which can be learned using approximations on the entropy.
